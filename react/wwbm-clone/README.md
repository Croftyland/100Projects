# Features!


### Tech
Who Wants to Be a Millioner uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) -  is a language for application-scale JavaScript.
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
* [ESlint](https://nodejs.org/) - is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
